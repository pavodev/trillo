## Trillo

This project has been developed while attending the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udemy.com</a> course **Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!** (<a href="http://jonas.io">Jonas.io</a>).

The main goal of this project was to position all the elements with the CSS Flexbox feature. This webpage is also responsive.
